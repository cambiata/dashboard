/**
	An interface describing an open HTTP session.

	The methods are similar to `Map`, with `get()`, `set()`, `exists()`, `remove()` and `clear()`.

	There are also some methods to do with the actual session, not the data inside it: `init()`, `isActive()`, `getID()`, `close()`, `commit()`, `regenerateID()` and `setExpiry()`.
